<p>This was one of my first JavaScript focused Projects. It's pretty straight forward. You can calculate numbers, typical add, divide, multiply, subtract.
One thing I improved upon was the ability to continually preform operations on previous solutions. Instead of being limited to a simple operation with two numbers and a product (6+6=12 or 12*3=36). Now you could do something like 6+6*3 and keep preforming operations without having to retype your answer.
<h2>JavaScript Fundementals</h2>
<p>In this porject I wanted to do something a little more complex and independent. I used a lot of class selecting and query Slecting</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Listeners</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>DOM manipulation</li>
<li>String methods/manipulation</li>
</ul>

<p>As an introductory project it was pretty fun and very informative.</p>
