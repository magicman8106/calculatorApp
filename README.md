<p>This was one of my first javaScript focued Projects. It's pretty straight forward. You can calculate numbers, typical add, divide, multipply, subtract.
One thing I improved upon was the ability to continually perform opperations on previous solutions. Instead of being limited to a simple operation with two numbers and a product (6+6=12 12*3=36). Now you could do something like 6+6*9 and keep performing operations without having to retype your answer.
